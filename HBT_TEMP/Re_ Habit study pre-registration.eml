Hi Tom,

Now I have. My remarks:
1) Note that the payment is only on the last day. Are we allowed to do =
that?
2) Based on our experience, I think it will be wise to verify with =
participants that they haven=E2=80=99t eat anything in the past 6 hours.
3) They need to fix the explanation for where to place each finger on =
the keyboard  ("show d =C3=A0 right middle finger, f =C3=A0 right left =
index, j =C3=A0 left index k =C3=A0 right middle finger")

BTW - For experiments using multiple BDMs / liking ratings in our lab we =
can adopt this part:
=E2=80=9C During the experiment you will be asked several times to say =
how/report how pleasant the snack is for you. We are asking this =
question several times, because we are not interested in how pleasant =
you find the snack in general, but more on how pleasant you find that =
particular piece of snack in that particular moment. =E2=80=9C  =20

Cheers,
Rani

>>>>> (1) Eva has prepared a draft of the pre-registration document for =
this
>>>>> replication project. Please look through this and send us any
>>>>> comments/suggested edits. Also, let us know if there specific =
names of
>>>>> students/RAs etc. to be added to the list of authors (no worries =
if there
>>>>> are still some TBD ? it of course won?t be a problem adding =
authors at a
>>>>> later stage of the process). We have just simply listed potential =
authors
>>>>> at the moment and there is no rule or precedent implied to the =
ordering.
>>>>> However, we should perhaps agree on a principle about how =
authorship
>>>>> ordering would be done for any subsequent paper that comes out of =
this. One
>>>>> proposal would be to put all the students/junior folks first, and =
all the
>>>>> senior authors last, and then within each category of junior vs =
senior,
>>>>> sorting authors by alphabetical order.  I personally don?t mind =
what
>>>>> ordering is used, so let me know if anyone has a strong opinion!
>>>>> (2) Eva is in the process of preparing a PsychToolBox =
implementation of
>>>>> the task, with instructions embedded etc.  Once this is finalized =
and we
>>>>> have confirmed every detail is correct with Eebie and Ahmet =
(Eebie?s grad
>>>>> student),  she will ship this out to everyone. Obviously, Lars and =
Tom will
>>>>> need to convert the relevant instructions into German and Hebrew
>>>>> respectively. However, one thing to note is that there may be =
subtle
>>>>> effects of how language is used on the task that might influence =
behavior.
>>>>> So, we probably need to try to match the meaning of the =
instructions as
>>>>> much as possible (in so far as this is linguistically feasible)? =
for
>>>>> instance using language during food ratings about ?wanting? the =
foods might
>>>>> have different effects on goal-directedness to asking people to =
just rate
>>>>> the pleasantness of the foods etc.
>>>>> (3) Next week I?m going to talk with Christian Ruff, Zurich about =
the
>>>>> possibility of his lab joining in the project, and should find out =
one way
>>>>> or the other by next week. So, we will hold off submitting the
>>>>> pre-registration until we get a final response from him as well as =
feedback
>>>>> from each of you (even if just a quick OK).
>>>>> (4) We will also put together an additional protocol description,
>>>>> listing as many factors that we can think of that might be =
important to
>>>>> standardize across labs, in consultation with Eebie and Ahmet, and =
we will
>>>>> share this with everyone.
>>>>> (5) Ahead of acquiring participants, Ahmet (who now has a lot of
>>>>> experience in running this task) has agreed to consult with the =
person
>>>>> running the study within each lab, to to try to ensure as much =
homogeneity
>>>>> as possible in terms of how we administer this. So let us know =
ahead of
>>>>> time when you each plan to run the protocol and we should touch =
base on how
>>>>> best to implement this experimenter training.
>>>>>=20

on-board!

I just had a look at the pre-registration document and the detailed =

comments:<br class=3D"">
1) instructions: It was not entirely clear to me whether you suggest to =
use written or verbal instructions. I would recommend to use written =
instructions throughout - this would also help to standardize procedures =
across labs. If we have the english instructions,
 we could simply translate them to Hebrew and German.<br class=3D"">

So, I think I would recommend a hybrid =E2=80=94 we will embed a lot of =
the instructions into the computer task, but at the same time, it=E2=80=99=
s important for the experimenter to engage with the participant, =
particularly as when running the devaluation procedure it=E2=80=99s =
necessary
 to encourage participants to eat as much as they need to devalue =E2=80=94=
 so having some kind of one-on-one interaction between the experimenter =
and participant is probably important for this.&nbsp; Eva is building in =
most of the instructions into the task itself, and
 then preparing a supplementary =E2=80=9Cstandard=E2=80=9D experimenter =
script which details what specific verbal instructions should be given =
at each phase of the experiment.&nbsp;</div>

FYI, this is what we have been doing recently in the lab in a few =
projects and it has worked quite well. It is a slight deviation from the =
original 2009 protocol, but as we don?t expect the specific identity of =
food items to be especially important for the
 presence or absence of the habit effect, it might be worth implementing =
this procedure in the replication for the reasons Eva mentions. Let me =
know what you think ? that way you could choose food items locally =

Lars'<br class=3D"">
point, we also exclude people who report having concerns of body weight. =
It<br class=3D"">
may be the case that even if they are not currently dieting, they =
could<br class=3D"">
have reservations about eating several servings of chocolate or chips =
when<br class=3D"">
it comes time to devalue. Our pre-screen also eliminates people who =
have<br class=3D"">
lost more than 20 lbs in the last six months, but that's also covered =
by<br class=3D"">
the EAT-26 (I recommend having the question in a pre-screen anyway to<br =
class=3D"">
prevent the headache of excluding someone after they've started the =
study).<br class=3D"">
The EAT-26 also has a section for flagging BMI outliers. I haven't =
excluded<br class=3D"">
anyone for it yet, but asking for height and weight in the pre-screen =
might<br class=3D"">
be a good idea.<br class=3D"">

Dear John, Dear all,<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Thanks for the update, John. Sounds all great. I just had a quick look =
at<br class=3D"">
the pre-registration document and only have two minor comments =
(attached).<br class=3D"">
When thinking about factors we need to standardize across labs, we =
should<br class=3D"">
take the time of day into account, I think, as there are some reportes =
that<br class=3D"">
habit learning processes might differ inthe morning vs. evening (due to =
the<br class=3D"">
diurnal rhythm of certain hormones, such as cortisol).<br class=3D"">
I will provide the name of the person who will run the study in our =

<br class=3D"">
Dear Bernard, Lars and Tom (cc Eva, Eebie and Ahmet),<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Thanks for agreeing to participate in this multi-lab replication =
study<br class=3D"">
of the effects of overtraining on habits.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
I just wanted to give you all some updates:<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
(1) Eva has prepared a draft of the pre-registration document for =
this<br class=3D"">
replication project. Please look through this and send us any<br =
class=3D"">
comments/suggested edits. Also, let us know if there specific names =
of<br class=3D"">
students/RAs etc. to be added to the list of authors (no worries if =
there<br class=3D"">
are still some TBD ? it of course won?t be a problem adding authors at =
a<br class=3D"">
later stage of the process). We have just simply listed potential =
authors<br class=3D"">
at the moment and there is no rule or precedent implied to the =
ordering.<br class=3D"">
However, we should perhaps agree on a principle about how authorship<br =
class=3D"">
ordering would be done for any subsequent paper that comes out of this. =
One<br class=3D"">
proposal would be to put all the students/junior folks first, and all =
the<br class=3D"">
senior authors last, and then within each category of junior vs =
senior,<br class=3D"">
sorting authors by alphabetical order.&nbsp; I personally don?t mind =
what<br class=3D"">
ordering is used, so let me know if anyone has a strong opinion!<br =
class=3D"">
(2) Eva is in the process of preparing a PsychToolBox implementation =
of<br class=3D"">
the task, with instructions embedded etc.&nbsp; Once this is finalized =
and we<br class=3D"">
have confirmed every detail is correct with Eebie and Ahmet (Eebie?s =
grad<br class=3D"">
student),&nbsp; she will ship this out to everyone. Obviously, Lars and =
Tom will<br class=3D"">
need to convert the relevant instructions into German and Hebrew<br =
class=3D"">
respectively. However, one thing to note is that there may be subtle<br =
class=3D"">
effects of how language is used on the task that might influence =
behavior.<br class=3D"">
So, we probably need to try to match the meaning of the instructions =
as<br class=3D"">
much as possible (in so far as this is linguistically feasible)? for<br =
class=3D"">
instance using language during food ratings about ?wanting? the foods =
might<br class=3D"">
have different effects on goal-directedness to asking people to just =
rate<br class=3D"">
the pleasantness of the foods etc.<br class=3D"">
(3) Next week I?m going to talk with Christian Ruff, Zurich about the<br =
class=3D"">
possibility of his lab joining in the project, and should find out one =
way<br class=3D"">
or the other by next week. So, we will hold off submitting the<br =
class=3D"">
pre-registration until we get a final response from him as well as =
feedback<br class=3D"">
from each of you (even if just a quick OK).<br class=3D"">
(4) We will also put together an additional protocol description,<br =
class=3D"">
listing as many factors that we can think of that might be important =
to<br class=3D"">
standardize across labs, in consultation with Eebie and Ahmet, and we =
will<br class=3D"">
share this with everyone.<br class=3D"">
(5) Ahead of acquiring participants, Ahmet (who now has a lot of<br =
class=3D"">
experience in running this task) has agreed to consult with the =
person<br class=3D"">
running the study within each lab, to to try to ensure as much =
homogeneity<br class=3D"">
as possible in terms of how we administer this. So let us know ahead =
of<br class=3D"">
time when you each plan to run the protocol and we should touch base on =
how<br class=3D"">
best to implement this experimenter training.<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Let me know if there any questions. It?s great to have you all =
on-board!<br class=3D"">
<br class=3D"">
Best wishes,<br class=3D"">
